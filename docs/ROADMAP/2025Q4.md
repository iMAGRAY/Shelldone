# Shelldone — Roadmap (Q4 2025)

## Vision
Make Shelldone the benchmark terminal platform: uncompromising quality, extreme performance, rich customisation, deep AI integration, and IDE-grade visuals.

## Quarterly Phases
1. **Codebase Hardening**
   - Finish `cargo fmt` / `clippy -D warnings` cleanup across the workspace.
  - Lock in performance budgets (`docs/architecture/perf-budget.md`).
  - Elevate `make verify` to strict mode (perf smoke, security, docs checks).

2. **Plugin Architecture & Customisation**
  - Stabilise the render/input/mux APIs and document them in `docs/architecture/customization-and-plugins.md`.
  - Ship the extension loader and core SDK.
  - Provide examples: themes, file manager, automation playbooks.

3. **AI & Automation**
  - Deliver the MCP/gRPC bridge (`docs/architecture/ai-integration.md`).
  - Define security policies for agent scenarios (`config/policies/`).
  - Build UI for observing and approving agent actions.

4. **Animation & Visual Effects Platform**
  - Introduce the new render loop and effects engine (`docs/architecture/animation-framework.md`).
  - Release a reference pack of effects plus adaptive presets.
  - Provide CLI/GUI tooling for authoring and publishing effects.

5. **IDE Functionality & Developer Experience**
  - File manager, LSP hub, DAP integration (plugin-driven).
  - Improve documentation (`docs/architecture/README.md`, `docs/community/contributor-handbook.md`).
  - Automate releases and feedback loops (issue triage, opt-in telemetry).

## Success Metrics
- `make verify VERIFY_MODE=ci` finishes under 15 minutes with zero warnings.
- Input-to-render ≤ 20 ms, tab switch ≤ 80 ms (see perf budget).
- At least 3 demo plugins and 5 public effects.
- MCP integration executes an end-to-end scenario (playbook → deploy).

## Organisation
- Epic ownership tracked in issues (`labels: roadmap/q4-2025`).
- Interim notes live in `docs/ROADMAP/notes/`.
- Every architectural decision requires an ADR (`docs/architecture/adr/`).
