# Shelldone Plugins Registry

This directory is reserved for first-party and community extensions.

- API documentation lives at `docs/architecture/customization-and-plugins.md`.
- Generated scaffolds must be committed under `plugins/templates/`.
- Published plugins and indices belong to `plugins/registry/` (populated by the SDK tooling).

Until the SDK ships this folder contains documentation stubs only.
